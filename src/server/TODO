    Currently there can only be a single active scene. That's not reasonable moving forward, because there will be more than one independant UI element on the screen.
    ✔ Update UI manager to support multiple scenes. @done(19-04-02 01:43)
    ✔ Update scenes to handle events by themselves instead of relying on outside calls. @done(19-04-04 18:03)
      ✔ Remove scene manager as this change would make it obsolete. @done(19-04-04 18:03)
      ✔ Auth scene @done(19-04-02 01:44)
      ✔ Character selection scene @done(19-04-04 18:02)
      ✔ Character creation scene @done(19-04-04 18:02)
  ✔ Use `inversify` for client side module management. @done(19-04-02 01:48)
  ✔ Update UI import paths. @done(19-04-04 18:18)
