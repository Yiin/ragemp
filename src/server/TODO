  ✔ Better client side scene management @started(19-04-02 01:48) @done(19-04-04 18:04) @lasted(2d16h16m38s)
    Currently there can only be a single active scene. That's not reasonable moving forward, because there will be more than one independant UI element on the screen.
    ✔ Update UI manager to support multiple scenes. @done(19-04-02 01:43)
    ✔ Update scenes to handle events by themselves instead of relying on outside calls. @done(19-04-04 18:03)
      ✔ Remove scene manager as this change would make it obsolete. @done(19-04-04 18:03)
      ✔ Auth scene @done(19-04-02 01:44)
      ✔ Character selection scene @done(19-04-04 18:02)
      ✔ Character creation scene @done(19-04-04 18:02)
  ✔ Use `inversify` for client side module management. @done(19-04-02 01:48)
  ✔ Update UI import paths. @done(19-04-04 18:18)
  ✔ Fix loading of client side modules @done(19-04-04 23:32)

Storylines & Quests:
  - Currently structure is as follows:
  -  Character has many storylines
  -    Each storyline has many quests
  -      Each quest has many steps
  -        Each step has many counters
  ✘ Consider simplifying ^ @cancelled(19-04-16 01:42)
    Recursive relation maybe? i.e. Quest can have many quests
  ☐ Define rewards
  ☐ Quest completion logic
    Automatically trigger quest completion once predefined conditions are met
  ☐ Quest management API
    Current:
      ✔ Start storyline for character @done(19-04-17 01:37)
        ✔ Start first quest in storyline for character @done(19-04-17 01:37)
          ✔ Add initial available steps for character @done(19-04-17 01:37)
      ☐ Increase quest step counter
      ☐ Complete quest step
      ☐ Complete quest
      ☐ Complete storyline
      ☐ Give rewards
    ✘ Recursive: @cancelled(19-04-16 01:42)
      ✘ Assign quest to character @cancelled(19-04-16 01:42)
      ✘ Complete quest for character @cancelled(19-04-16 01:42)
